                    <li>Pani (Spicy Water):</li>
                    <ol>
                    
                        <li> Blend everything except the water together to make a fine paste. While blending, add water as needed to blend.</li>
                        <li>Taste to adjust the green chilies as they can be mild or hot. Add more lemon juice, sugar, and salt as needed to your desired taste. Remember you will be adding more water to dilute so paste should be spicier. Strain the paste using water as needed.</li>
                            <li> After straining mix the paste with remaining water or adjusting to the taste.</li>
                                <li>The pani (water) will taste best if refrigerated for a day.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>

                        <li>To make Puris:</li>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Mix the flour and sooji. Add water as needed to make firm dough. Knead the dough until it is pliable. Cover the dough with a damp cloth for about ten minutes.</li>
                        <li>Damp two kitchen towels, spread one damp towel over a cookie sheet or plain surface, close to where you are going to fry the puris.</li>
                        <li> Divide the dough into about 60 small balls. Keep them under a damp cloth.</li>
                        <li>Start rolling each ball to about a 2-inch diameter circle. Place over a damp towel and cover with another damp towel. Do this for all 60 puris. TIP: Placing the puris between damp cloths helps the puris to puff evenly on all sides.</li>
                        <li>Heat the oil on medium high heat. Oil should be about 1 1/2 inch high in frying pan. To test the oil, put a little piece of dough in the oil. The oil is ready if the dough comes up right away and does not change color.</li>
                        <li>Start frying the puris, starting first with the puri you first rolled.</li>
                        <li>Put one puri in the oil and press lightly. When it puffs turn over and put another puri in the oil. Keep adding six to eight puris at a time. Fry the puris until they are golden-brown all around by turning a few times. You may adjust the heat as needed while frying.</li>
                        <li>Take the puris out and place over paper towel, so the excess oil is absorbed. TIP: When taking the puris out of the frying pan, make sure to tilt the skimmer so that the excess oil is drained before placing on the paper towel.</li>
                        <li>Fry all the puris. They should be crisp and puff like a ball.</li>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
          <li> Before you start preparing the batter get the steamer ready. Add water in the steamer, cover it and bring water to a boil. Alternatively you can place a ring into a kadai and use a lid that covers the kadai completely.
            Lightly grease a 8inch round tin on the sides. Place a piece of round butter paper on the bottom and keep it aside.</li>
            
         <li>  For the batter sift gram flour (besan) in a bowl. Sprinkle salt and turmeric on to it. Mix together water, curd, sugar, green chilli paste, ginger paste and oil. Pour ¾ of this over the besan. Whisk the batter in one direction for about 5 minutes. This will make the batter light and fluffy.
            Once you have worked up the batter add lemon juice and baking soda. If you do not have baking soda you can add fruit salts aka ENO.</li>
            
          <li> Mix them gently in one direction and wait for 30 secs. Pour the batter inside the ready mould and place it in the steamer immediately. Cover and cook the dhokla for about 30mins. After 30mins turn off the heat and let the dhokla sit covered in the steamer for 10min.
            In the mean time we will get the flavoured syrup ready. Heat a pan and drizzle oil, add mustard seeds and once they pop add in slit green chillies along with curry leaves. Toss them for a minute. Add water, sugar, salt and lemon juice. Bring to a boil and remove from heat.</li>
            
            <li> Now carefully remove the mould from the steamer and let it cool a bit (not completely). Run a knife along the sides of the pan and remove the dhokla carefully on to a deep plate or platter.
            Pour the syrup over the dhokla and let the dhokla soak up the syrup completely. Make sure that the temperature of syrup and dhokla should be Luke warm (both).
            Wait for 10mins and then serve them, you can also put them in a fridge for 2 hours before serving.</li>
